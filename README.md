# Analytical-Website-AxeGG
This is repository for my website http://axe.gg that provides League of Legends players with analytics, statistics, and information with live-updated data. For the client I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript , and jQuery to make a dynamic website. For the server I use Node.js, Express.js, and REST API.
